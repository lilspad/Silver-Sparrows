# SilverSparrows
codecademy project: Company Website;

Silver Sparrows is a ficational paper comapny for which I designed and built a comapany website. 
There was no design spec provided, just vague instructions such as: 
- Include a mission statement
- Include product details
- Include a section about the employees
- Use flexbox layout
- Use custom styling, including some Google Fonts


It is only the front page, ideally the 'About us', 'Catalog' and 'Locations' nav items would all lead to corresponding pages, 
also accessible through buttons further down the site.

At the moment there is no live website as it is still a work in progress.

All quotes used are from Micheal Scott, a character in The Office (U.S). I filled in 'description' fields in order to give the website a more authentic feel.
'The People' section image is of the characters in The Office (U.S).
